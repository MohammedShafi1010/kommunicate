If I start a company I would select my friend Bharath and Gautham gopan as my partners because Gautham is a good public speaker and he is good in marketing and bharath is great in developing product ideas.
since I have good amount of technical knowledge and can understand businessess very well we can collaborate well and can manage different roles in the company.
