I have created **AI enabled invoice management system**. which is a dashboard where we can see the records of invoices, add, delete, search, and predict the payment of the invoice.
For this project I developed machine learning model to predict the invoice payment date, used mysql for database, java for backend where I used servelets and jdbc and for front end I used react framework.
